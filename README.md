This project is part of The Net Ninja's Udemy Course "Build Web Apps with Vue JS 2 & Firebase".

Building this project helped me to learn : 
- how to install Vue JS using the CLI; 
- how to create an application with Vue JS from scratch;
- how to apply the CRUD concept to an application; 
- how to use Firebase database.
- how to deploy an app with Firestore.
